My Python Codes

I love beatboxing, singing, and long walks on the beach.

  D&D code: Able to type in the type of dice you want to use and it rendomly generates a random number for that dice
            type. It keeps track of the number of times you roll the dice. It prints a short textual response to the
            value of your roll. Then repeats loop.
