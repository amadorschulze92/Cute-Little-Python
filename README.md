Some of My Random Python Code

Some simple/early python codes I wrote for fun or to help me save time.

  D&D code: Able to type in the type of dice you want to use and it randomly generates a number for that dice
            type. It keeps track of the number of times you roll the dice. It prints a short textual response to the
            value of your roll. Then repeats loop.
            
  append_table: For a sql database enter table and prints basic commands in case I forget or if I have to run many at a time.
            
  email: Pulls the domains from emails.
            
  letter_count: Counts the number of letters in a string.
            
  webtest: Hits a website multiple times till pulls a http error
            
  word_scramble: Throws a string variable in all available places in a constant string
