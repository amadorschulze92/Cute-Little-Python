My Python Codes

Some simple/early python codes I wrote for fun or to help me save time.

  D&D code: Able to type in the type of dice you want to use and it randomly generates a number for that dice
            type. It keeps track of the number of times you roll the dice. It prints a short textual response to the
            value of your roll. Then repeats loop.
